# Basic Ruby Example

This is a basic example of a Ruby application.

It is a **zero configuration** example: there is no Appfile. Just run
`otto compile` and everything will just work.

This application is a simple [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/)
static application. We chose Middleman to make this example as simple
as possible.
