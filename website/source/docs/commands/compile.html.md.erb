# Command: compile

The `compile` command tells Otto to prepare to manage your application. Otto
configures itself with smart defaults by detecting what kind of application
exists in the current directory. Using the optional
[Appfile](/docs/appfile/index.html), you can also add specific config to
override or modify Otto's default.

Otto then generates all the [Vagrant](https://vagrantup.com),
[Packer](https://packer.io), and [Terraform](https://terraform.io) config
necessary to develop, build, and deploy your application. These generated
configs are stored under the `.otto` directory for easy inspection. (Otto only
stores local data in the `.otto` - it is not meant to be checked it to revision
control.)

During compilation, Otto also generates unique identifier for your app and
stores this in `.ottoid`. This helps ensure that multiple applications deployed
into the same infrastructure will not collide or be duplicated. This file
should be checked in to version control.

## Usage

```
otto compile
```

This is meant to be the first command you run in your application's root
directory. Otto's other commands will detect if `otto compile` still needs to
be run and let you know.
