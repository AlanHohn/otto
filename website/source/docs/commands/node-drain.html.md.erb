# Command: node-drain

The `node-drain` command is used to toggle drain mode on a given node. Drain
mode prevents any new tasks from being allocated to the node, and begins
migrating all existing allocations away.

The [node-status](/docs/commands/node-status.html) command compliments this
nicely by providing the current drain status of a given node.

## Usage

```
nomad node-drain [options] <node>
```

This command expects exactly one argument to specify the node ID to enable or
disable drain mode for. It is also required to pass one of `-enable` or
`-disable`, depending on which operation is desired.

## General Options

## Node Drain Options

* `-disable`: Disable node drain mode.

## Examples

$ nomad node-drain -enable node1
```
