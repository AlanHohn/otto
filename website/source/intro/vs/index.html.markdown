# Otto vs. Other Software

Otto does a lot, and there are other tools in the market currently
that claim to do what Otto does. This section compares Otto to
these other software choices.

Due to the bias of the comparisons being on the Otto website, we attempt
to only use facts. If you find something that is invalid or out of date
in the comparisons, please
[open an issue](https://github.com/hashicorp/otto/issues) and we'll
address it as soon as possible.

Use the navigation on the left to read comparisons of Otto versus other
software.
